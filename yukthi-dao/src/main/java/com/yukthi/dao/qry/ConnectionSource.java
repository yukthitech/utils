 * ConnectionSource acts as the source of DB connections for QueryManager.
 * <BR/><BR/>
 * QueryManager by itself does not maintain transactions. So if multiple queries needs to be executed
 * as a single ATOMIC transaction, then a explicit ConnectionSource should be used. And commit should 
 * be done only at the successful completion of all queries.
 * <BR/><BR/>
 * QueryManager invokes commit() at end of each DML statements executed via executeUpdate(). Its upto the
 * implementations to maintain transactions.
 * <BR/><BR/>
 * Note: Instead of returning java.sql.Connection, getConnection() returns DBConnection implementations.
 * This is to facilitate developers to add Wrapper around SQL Connection with required attributes. The 
 * same attributes will be accessible during closeConnection() & commit()
 * @param <DBC> Wrapper class for Connection Object.
