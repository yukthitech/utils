Special xml namespace for functions
	function-ref should be invokable directly and should be able to pass params directly something like below
		<func:factorial value="4" />

======================
Collection/map steps
	create new collection/map
	add/put an entry
	remove an entry
	filter entries
		filter based on free marker expression
		result as different attr or same (defaults to same)
	find an entry (similar to filter but results in single entry)
	compare 2 collections for equality
	contains all functionality

Remove raw resource types and ccg:skipExpressions for skipping expression parsing
	this should set flag on context which should be referrd in automation utils
	
In SetStep and others wherever object is expected we should be able to inject value using ccg:attrRef

===================
	Default data source should be possible
	
	

	Ability to specify load order

	Step to comparare collections (ordered and unordered)

	
	rest steps to use different base urls
	
	Test cases for ui steps/validators
	
	customizations doc
	
	Step group doc

	screen shot on error
	
	
	
	Step to fail test case
	
	not equals validation

	renmote log
		fetch only on error
		enabled/disabled
		
	logger should be enabled on demand, or may want to enabled only on error

Exection plan
	executing dependency test cases

In final report skip test suites which are not executed

artifacts/Doc upload to yukthitech.com

========================
Doc
============
Examples for each
other documents

command line arguments doc
resource and references
data beans and load time references

expected exception doc

step groups and references

==============

Extra params in final report
	like build, environment, date, custom params
	
	
time taken by test cases and steps

Line number in xml based errors

================================================
Reports
	Simple overview report without external dependencies
		as pdf??
		logo??
	
==========================



why first driver is not being used?

=======================================

Test Cases
	Expected Exception
		Successful
		never occurred
		mismatched
	
	Basic
		step results in error
		validation result in error
		validation failed
		
	Data provider
		provides empty list
		one object results in error
		one object results in failure
		
		
	test cases to validate cmd args

	file upload and download
		resources
		
	test case to ensure skip and failure
========================================
Listener and ui
