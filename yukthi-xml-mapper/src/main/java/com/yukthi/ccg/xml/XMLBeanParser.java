/**
 * XMLBeanParser maps XML file data to a bean or in short generates a bean from
 * XML data. XMLBeanParser works with a simple logic/assumption that entire XML
 * file represents a single bean called <B>"root bean"</B> and all sub-nodes and
 * attributes are the properties of that root bean. <BR>
 * <BR>
 * 
 * 
 * <B>Types of Nodes</B> <BR>
 * <BR>
 * XMLBeanParser does not support meta-text nodes. A node having text and sub
 * nodes in its body. While loading XML file, XMLBeanParser groups/treats the
 * XML nodes to be in one of the follwoing group as per the description given
 * below:
 * <OL>
 * <LI><B>Standard Node:</B> A node with/without attributes and with/without sub
 * nodes. <BR>
 * This type of nodes represent a bean and all the node attributes and sub-nodes
 * will be mapped to this bean properties (setters and adders). <BR>
 * <BR>
 * Note: Reserved attributes (described below) will not be considered while
 * determining, a node as standard node.</LI>
 * <LI><B>Text Node:</B> A node which has only text (or CDATA section) in its
 * body and doesnt have any standard attributes. White spaces at the starting
 * and end will get trimmed. Even if the text spans multiple lines, whitespaces
 * will be trimmed only at starting and ending of the text. Intermidiate
 * whitespaces will not be effected. <BR>
 * Eg., &lt;Query&gt; Select * from emp &lt;/Query&gt; <BR>
 * <BR>
 * This type of node represents a property of the bean representing immediate
 * enclosing parent node. For example, setQuery(String) <BR>
 * Note: Reserved attributes (described below) will not be considered while
 * determining, a node as text node.</LI>
 * <LI><B>ID-Based Text Node:</B> A node which is having only text (or CDATA
 * section) in its body and have only one single standard attribute (with any
 * name). The text will be trimmed just like normal text nodes. <BR>
 * Eg., &lt;skill name="java"&gt; 5 &lt;/skill&gt; <BR>
 * <BR>
 * This type of node represents a ID based property (or mapping property) of the
 * bean representing immediate enclosing parent node. For example,
 * setSkill(String,int) <BR>
 * Note: Reserved attributes (described below) will not be considered while
 * determining, a node as ID based text node.</LI>
 * <LI><B>Meta Text Node:</B> A node which is having combination of text and
 * sub-nodes in its body. Or mutiple standard attributes and with text in its
 * body. <BR>
 * <B>This type of nodes are not supported by XMLBeanParser.</B></LI>
 * </OL>
 * <B>Note:</B> Even though meta-text nodes are not supported by XMLBeanParser,
 * XMLBeanParser will not consider trailing whitespaces (generally used for
 * indentation) as part of text.
 * 
 * 
 * <BR>
 * <BR>
 * <B>Reserve Nodes and Attributes</B> <BR>
 * <BR>
 * All the nodes and attributes which are in "/fw/ccg/XMLBeanParser" namespace
 * are treated as reserve nodes and attributes respectively. The loading of
 * these reserve nodes or using of reserved attributes are expected to be taken
 * care by Parser Handler.
 * 
 * <B>Mapping XML Data to Bean Properties</B> <BR>
 * <BR>
 * In order to design XML files that can be parsed by Bean parser its very
 * important to understand the logic how XML elements gets mapped to bean
 * properties. Following points describes how XML elements are mapped to beans
 * and their properties: <BR>
 * <BR>
 * <OL>
 * <LI><B>Node and SubNodes:</B>The root of the XML data is represented by the
 * root bean. For each subnode under this node, setter/adder will be searched in
 * root bean which matches with the subnode name and which takes single
 * attribute. If both adder and setter are present then adder will be used. If
 * multiple subnodes are present then the selected adder/setter will be called
 * multiple times. <BR>
 * For example,<BR>
 * &lt;Query&gt;&lt;select&gt; <BR>
 * ....................<BR>
 * &lt;/select&gt;&lt;/Query&gt;<BR>
 * <BR>
 * 
 * Say in the above example if Query is the root of the XML, then under root
 * bean setSelect() and addSelect() will be searched and lets say there is a
 * method called addSelect(SelectQuery qry) in the root bean. Then an instanceof
 * SelectQuery will be created and the same process is repeated for
 * &lt;select&gt; node and the resultant bean is passed to addSelect() of root
 * bean. <BR>
 * Thus for nested subnodes beans will be created and gets assigned to the bean
 * representing enclosing node.</LI>
 * <LI><B>Text Node:</B> Text node is also processed in the same way as subnode
 * but the paramter accepted by appropriate setter/adder should be one of the
 * supported attribute types mentioned below.</LI>
 * <LI><B>Attributes:</B> For each attribute setter (only) will be searched
 * which matches with the name of the attribute. The parameter type of the
 * matching setter can be one of the supported attribute types mentioned below.
 * </LI>
 * </OL>
 * 
 * 
 * <BR>
 * <BR>
 * <B>Supported Attribute Types</B> <BR>
 * <BR>
 * The current version of the XMLBeanParser supports following data types for
 * attributes and text based sub-nodes (both normal and ID based). In ID-based
 * text nodes, both the id and the value can be one of the following types.
 * <OL>
 * <LI>Primitive Types</LI>
 * <LI>Primitive Wrapper classes</LI>
 * <LI>java.lang.String</LI>
 * <LI>java.lang.StringBuffer</LI>
 * <LI>java.util.Date</LI>
 * </OL>
 * <BR>
 * Note: If multiple version of methods (overloaded) are available in the bean
 * with above types, then the selection of method for that property can not be
 * determined. <BR>
 * <BR>
