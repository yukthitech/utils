data provider in steps

invoke method step (with params)
	result should be set on context
		result attribute name
		
	exception also on context
	
	ability to validate exception or result (Which is on result)

	ability to invoke method with different variations - form validations

Reusable step groups

	
Rest based Steps
	get and post urls?
	
	post with file upload



logging the object as json

fail step

Folder wise execution
	Multiple folders
	


Listener and ui


Validate form with field level validations



ui form validator
	different variations of data
	

Test Drag and drop step

Test remote file log monitor

================================================
Reports
	Simple overview report without external dependencies
		as pdf??
		logo??
	
==========================


Param and auto doc generation

why first driver is not being used?

=============================

property files to load to context
	that can be used in app config also and in steps also

Extra params in final report
	like build, environment, date, custom params
	
list loading by delimiter
	
Extra steps
	json parsing
	
	
	create temp file in work dir
	
	read and write file
		write json object to fil
		
	data provider steps
		at test case level and step level
	
	screen shot on error
	
	log message step
	
	test case to ensure skip and failure
	
	eror and failure differentiation
	
	
	test cases to validate cmd args
	
	group names in test cases
	
	file upload and download
		resources
		
	jx path validation of properties
	
	Step to fail test case
	
	if-else
	
	loops
	
	reusing of step groups
	
	Name of the report
	
	Freemarker to have common header and for report files
		using some file to get list of files to copy
		
	
	
	
	
	
Date and time formats from app config
	
In all steps and validations only string params should be accepted
	so that they can be replaced by expresssions by user
	
	
Ability to disable expected exception

Log file processor

support for app properties/json and via dynamic class

Startup (initial log) log by logi monitors

time taken by test cases and steps
=======================================

Test Cases
	Expected Exception
		Successful
		never occurred
		mismatched
	
	Basic
		step results in error
		validation result in error
		validation failed
		
	Data provider
		provides empty list
		one object results in error
		one object results in failure
