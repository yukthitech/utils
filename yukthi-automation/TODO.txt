Multi dml query step (single transaction)

setup and cleanup

functions (repeatable set of stpes)
	step to invoke functions with params

step to set context variables
	value in turn can be expression on context

Validate form with field level validations

step to load property file on context 

invoke method step (with params)
	result should be set on context
		result attribute name
		
	exception also on context
	
	ability to validate exception or result (Which is on result)

	ability to invoke method with different variations - form validations


ui form validator
	different variations of data
	
Drag and drop step

==================================================	
Test cases

==================================================	

Loggers
	local console logger
	local file log monitor
	
	remote file monitor
	
Ability to define multiple log monitors -> in app config file
	mark them as default ones
	
Ability to include or exclude log monitors


================================================
Reports
	Simple overview report without external dependencies
		as pdf??
		logo??
	
	Detail report
		logo
		links to logs (normal log + log monitors)
		stripped tables
			highlighting row
		fixed position headers
		Filters based on 
			test suite and 
			test case
			success/failure/skipped
			
	Log displayers
		Pattern to define columns
		Line grouping
			based on group values
		excluded and included line texts	
		group value based filter
	
==========================
Rename sub config to plugin and make approp annotation changes

Dml Query / Multi Dml
 Error on DML failure
 Log the query
 Log the update count
 
 means of setting update count on context
 
 on error log the exception and message to ui
 
Prop Step
 Load from file or resource
 on error log the exception and message to ui
 

General
 Ensure log4j logging is done for input parameters
 and on errors
 
 Use Validatable interface to ensure required params are provided
 
Step to set context variable

Use ValidateContextParamStep to validate sql load is successul


Param and auto doc generation

why first driver is not being used?

Source of the log in the system log

even in init error display command line args

step to set context param value

=============================

property files to load to context
	that can be used in app config also and in steps also

Extra params in final report
	like build, environment, date, custom params
	
list loading by delimiter
	
Extra steps
	json parsing
	
	get and post urls?
	
	post with file upload
	
	create temp file in work dir
	
	read and write file
		write json object to fil
		
	data provider steps
		at test case level and step level
	
	expressions using freemarker
	
	screen shot on error
	
	log message step
	
	test case to ensure skip and failure
	
	eror and failure differentiation
	
	
	test cases to validate cmd args
	
	group names in test cases
	
	file upload and download
		resources
		
	jx path validation of properties
	
	Step to fail test case
	
	if-else
	
	loops
	
	reusing of step groups
	
	cloned copy of bean
	
	deep-cloned copy of bean
